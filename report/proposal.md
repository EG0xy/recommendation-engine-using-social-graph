# Community Detection in Social Graphs and its Application 

## Section 1: Background

Detecting communities and the influencers within that community is a key in analysis of social networks. There are multiple approaches to community detection and determining who are the influencers **find papers pls**. Its applications ranges from biology to sociology. In our project, we seek to detect communities in the Foursquare social network and its influencers. We also aim to evaluate if such analysis can be incorporated in a recommendation engine. 

## Section 2: Motivation

Before the current pervasiveness of social networks, analysis of customers or potential customers typically involves mining their demographics and clustering customers with similar attributes together. The insights gleaned may then be used for making recommendations to customers based on their profiles. 

Our motivation primarily arise from the fact that social network data are now also available for analysis. While the above approach may still be relevant, we can now cluster customers according to their communities for making recommendations given the fact that one is more likely to trust a "friend". Through identifying influencers within the community, targeted marketing can be done **(really?)**. 

## Section 3: About the Dataset

This dataset will be retrieved from Foursquare through 2 channels. 

1) Foursqure API - For users, venues and photos data
2) Web Scraping - For reviews, not available via the Foursquare API. 

The records used for this analysis are summarized below:

| Data Set :                | # of Records|
| :-------------|:-------------:|
| Users : | 16,736|
| Venues : |132,308  |
| Photos : |132,308  |
| Tips? Reviews? : |132,308  |

**<Insert details on user, venues, photos etc>**

## Section 4: Analysis 

Questions we seek to answer are on 2 levels. Namely, community and restaurants.  

#### Community
**What kind of photo (food / face / random) does one tend to share of restaurant given one's membership in a community?**
* We propose to first detect the community membership of the individual. 
* Based on the community membership, 

**Are the different communities based on photos, restaurants visited and the feedback shared?**
* We propose to do this by ...

**Who are the influencers within a particular community and are there different influencers for different restaurants or food items?**
* We propose to do this by ...

#### Restaurants 

**What restaurants do people visit, even though the comments are bad?**
* How to do this?

**Is there a way to determine the rating of a restaurant by the photos posted?**
* How?

## Section 5: Evaluation 

How do we plan to evaluate whether our analysis make sense / can be applied?
