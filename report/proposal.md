# Community Detection in Social Graphs and its Application 

## Section 1: Background

Detecting communities and the influencers within that community is a key in analysis of social networks. There are multiple approaches to community detection and determining who are the influencers **find papers pls**. Its applications ranges from biology to sociology. In our project, we seek to detect communities in the Foursquare social network and its influencers. We also aim to assess the effectiveness of using the output of such an analysis in a recommendation engine. 

## Section 2: Motivation

Our motivation primarily arise from the fact that food is a favourite past time in Singapore. While there is an abundance of information on where are some of the nicer foods on the island, there are limited ways to discover novel cuisines or restaurants based on one's preferences. Given that social network data are now readily available for analysis, we can now detect the various communities present in Singapore when it comes to food, and perhaps use the information for making recommendations.
 
 The output of the analysis can then be used by bloggers to help decide on the cuisines to cover so as to appeal to certain communities, or even in a recommendation engine as part of a web portal or mobile application.  

## Section 3: About the Dataset

This dataset will be retrieved from Foursquare through 2 methods. 

* **Foursqure API** - For users, venues and photos data
* **Web Scraping** - For reviews, not available via the Foursquare API. 

The records used for this analysis are summarized below:

| Data Set :                | # of Records|
| :-------------|:-------------:|
| Users : | 16,736|
| Venues : |132,308  |
| Photos : |132,308  |
| Tips? Reviews? : |132,308  |

## Section 4: Analysis 

Questions we seek to answer are on 2 levels. Namely, community and restaurants.  

#### Community
**What kind of photo (food / face / random) does one tend to share of restaurant given one's membership in a community?**
* We propose to first detect the community membership of the individual. 
* Based on the community membership, 

**Are the different communities based on photos, restaurants visited and the feedback shared?**
* We propose to do this by ...

**Who are the influencers within a particular community and are there different influencers for different restaurants or food items?**
* We propose to do this by ...

#### Restaurants 

**What restaurants do people visit, even though the comments are bad?**
* How to do this?

**Is there a way to determine the rating of a restaurant by the photos posted?**
* How?
