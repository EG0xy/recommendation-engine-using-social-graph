# For all config files

**Example**

```python
[yelp]
consumer_key=asdf23dDf2_dFdfdfs
consumer_secret=AdGT54DFdfHtGh5345GFDehRggDdfHUU54SSDsssdf
access_token_key=asdf34dfaf9dDFadsDf
access_token_secret=asdfdfDf3feERefdffd
client_id=asldkfj2l3k4jlkj234
client_secret=k4jlkdlkfj3k4jkjdkj34kj
```

* Note: client_id/secret is for oauth2, while the rest is for oauth1

* The above is fake, for obvious reasons. The file will be read in by collection python files and used to authenticate against the social media platforms to extract data. The ini file will be ignored by git.
